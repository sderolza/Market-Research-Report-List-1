<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neurovascular stent retrievers market comprises two main types: balloon-expanding stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expanding stents are deployed using a balloon mechanism to expand at the target site, providing precise vessel support. Conversely, self-expanding stents automatically adjust to the vessel diameter upon deployment, ensuring a secure fit. Both types are crucial in treating conditions like aneurysms and occlusions, enhancing blood flow and improving patient outcomes in neurovascular interventions. Their selection depends on the specific clinical needs and anatomy.</p></p>
