<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oral</li><li>Intrathecal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) treatment market comprises two primary types: oral and intrathecal delivery methods. Oral treatments, such as small molecule medications, are administered by mouth and are designed to enhance survival motor neuron (SMN) protein production. Intrathecal treatments involve direct delivery into the spinal canal, allowing for higher concentrations of the medication to reach the central nervous system, improving efficacy. Both methods aim to manage SMA symptoms and improve patient outcomes, tailoring treatment to individual needs.</p></p>
