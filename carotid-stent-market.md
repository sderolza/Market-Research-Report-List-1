<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carotid Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTA</li><li>CAS</li><li>CEA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carotid stent market comprises three main types: Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA), Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS), and Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA). PTA involves using a balloon to open narrowed arteries, enhancing blood flow. CAS employs stents to keep arteries open and prevent restenosis, offering a less invasive option. CEA, a surgical procedure, removes plaque buildup in the carotid arteries, reducing stroke risk. Each method serves specific patient needs in improving vascular health and addressing carotid artery diseases.</p></p>
