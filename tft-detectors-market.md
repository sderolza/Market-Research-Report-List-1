<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TFT Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TFT (Thin Film Transistor) detectors are utilized in digital radiography for capturing images. The market is primarily divided into two types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use a scintillator to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then detected by the TFT array. In contrast, direct conversion detectors employ materials that directly convert X-rays into electrical signals, offering improved image quality and faster processing. Both types serve essential roles in enhancing radiographic imaging efficiency and accuracy in medical settings.</p></p>
