<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV Filter in Personal Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Filters</li><li>Physical Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the personal care market, UV filters are classified into two primary types: chemical and physical filters. Chemical filters absorb UV rays and convert them into heat, which is then released from the skin, making them effective for lightweight formulations. In contrast, physical filters, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, create a physical barrier on the skin's surface that reflects and scatters UV rays. Both types are essential for sun protection, catering to different consumer preferences and skin sensitivities.</p></p>
